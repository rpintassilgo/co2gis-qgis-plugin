"""Data model and Level-1 assignment for the pipeline-network feature.

Pure Python — no Qt, no PyQGIS — so it is unit-testable and safe off the UI
thread. A network is a set of :class:`Node` objects (sources carry an emission
``flow``, sinks carry an injection ``capacity``) joined by :class:`Edge` links.

Level 1 links each source to its nearest sink (Euclidean) as an independent
"star"; ``length``/``cost`` on each edge are filled later by the GRASS routing
stage. Later levels add shared trunks (Level 2) and MILP selection (Level 3).
